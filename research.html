                            We study the implications of the Chinese waste import ban of 2018 on intra-European plastic waste trade. Specifically, we ask if it led to a ``waste haven'' effect, which would imply that countries with high disposal and recycling costs started to export more plastic waste to countries with lower costs. We study this question in a gravity difference-in-differences setting with detailed data on the costs of waste processing. We find strong evidence that countries with higher costs of disposal indeed started to export more waste towards lower cost countries as a result of this ban. We do not find consistent evidence that more waste was exported to countries with lower recycling costs. Our results raise distributional questions about the allocation of waste externalities in integrated markets and have implications for current debates on the legislation of international waste shipments.

                           This paper analyzes the effects of carbon taxation and carbon border adjustments in a setting
                    where firms can choose to respond to taxation by abating, or by outsourcing part of their production.
                    For this, we set up a general equilibrium trade model, calibrated with world trade and input-output 
                    data that features a discrete choice production structure, where the producers choose between 
                    outsourcing or abating emission-intensive intermediate production steps. The paper finds that
                    border adjustments that only target scope 1 emissions can lead to outsourcing, and thus leakage, 
                    further down the value chain, but nevertheless induce higher abatement both in the countries that
                    impose the border adjustment and in the ones affected by it.

                           We study the effects of market integration on manufacturing emission intensities of CO2, SOx, and NOx.
                            For this, we analyse the 2004 and 2007 EU enlargements in a sectoral panel with data on almost all EU member states from 1995 to 2015.
                            We pay close attention to relevant channels of trade, regulation, and efficiency.
                            Overall, the enlargements have resulted in a reduction of emission intensities in new member states: new regulations,
                            which accession countries needed to adopt, have lowered pollution intensities strongly; induced improvements in productivity have further reduced them;
                            and trade integration into the EU has had insignificant effects on emission intensities. 
                            We also do not find evidence of within-EU pollution haven effects and thus of leakage from old to new member states. 
                            For old members, trade integration, if anything, increased emission intensities, 
                            but efficiency improvements have also contributed to cleaner manufacturing sectors here.

                           Free trade can drive efficiency increases in the utilization of natural
                           resources, but it can also leave countries overly exposed to foreign
                           sources of raw materials. Furthermore it can induce material intensive
                           production to relocate abroad if more stringent rules are adopted at
                           home, a phenomenon known as "leakage" in the trade and environment
                           literature.  Applying well-established concepts and analyses from
                           the trade and pollution literature to the effects of free trade on
                           natural resources and materials, we find statistically significant,
                           but economically small evidence, for higher income countries decreasing
                           their material usage when opening up for trade, while lower income 
                           countries increase theirs. This indicates some for of outsourcing.
                           We also find that the famous environmental Kuznets curve behavior seems 
                           to be present for materials as well, but the evidence on this is weaker
                           than for CO2. Finally, the similarities between the
                           results for raw materials and those for CO2 indicate that well-designed
                           policy that addresses both domains and takes trade channels into consideration could increase the desired outcomes.

Using a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model I simulate two different shock specifications as observed in credit panel data; one transitory and one permanent credit shock. I show that consumption insurance drops sharply on impact for both kind of shocks. The permanent shock induces a lower level of consumption insurance in the long run. Moreover, I show that these effects differ by current wealth holdings, with households at the lower end of the wealth distribution experiencing the largest drop. Consumption insurance measures in the data, computed with the new PSID consumption series, suggest that the credit shock induced by the grand financial crisis was transitory in nature. Consumption insurance reaches its trough in 2010, but bounces back to its pre-crisis value by 2016.</p> -->

                           <p align="justify"> This paper examines the impact of EU climate policies - specifically the industry-focused Emissions Trading System (ETS 1) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - on trade patterns in the EU, with a focus on the Netherlands. Using the GREEN-R computable general equilibrium (CGE) model developed by CPB and PBL, we simulate how these policies reshape the Dutch economy over a ten-year horizon. Results suggest a shift away from emission-intensive manufacturing sectors toward lower-emission sectors such as services, both in the EU and the Dutch economy. The ETS raises production costs for targeted industries, which may affect international competitiveness and could lead to carbon leakage through lower exports and higher imports. The CBAM is projected to partially offset these effects by discouraging imports of carbon-intensive goods. Meanwhile, the transition to a higher use of renewable energy drives a sharp reduction in fossil fuel imports, improving the fossil fuel trade balance. Impacts on trade in industrial goods are more heterogeneous and depend on sectoral emission intensity and competitiveness. Linking these outcomes to Dutch labour market data, model simulations suggest that overall employment effects are limited, though some affected sectors may experience job losses in some occupations, such as engineering.

                           <p align="justify"> We asses the dynamics of the relationship 
                           between trade and circular economy outcomes; both in the EU and globally.
                         We focus specifically on developing countries and highlight the dependence
                          of the EU on marterial-intense imports from countries outside the block.

                             <p align="justify"> The introduction of widespread trade restrictions between the West and both Russia and China (referred to as decoupling) precipitates significant short-term shifts in trade flows. The impact on various Dutch industries differs notably. Over the long term, decoupling adversely impacts the Dutch economy, albeit in a manner consistent with other Western nations. Notably, China and Russia face more severe repercussions than the West when trade relations are halted.

                                 <p align="justify"> The Dutch manufacturing industry is undergoing significant changes, with a growing emphasis on income derived from services. We are witnessing a gradual shift in the types of activities that contribute to the Netherlands' earnings from global production chains. Workers in the Netherlands earn from goods made both domestically and abroad, but there is an increase in earnings from services such as consultancy, alongside a decline in earnings from production activities like assembly.
